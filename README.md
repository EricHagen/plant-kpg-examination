# plant-kpg-examination
This project examines the conclusions of Thompson and Ramirez-Barahona (2023), which argues that flowering plants did not experience a mass extinction at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. 

Initial tests of TESS model fits to the Smith and Brown tree, following the analysis by Thompson and Ramirez-Barahona (2023), can be found in critique_kpg_paper.R, while my fits of simulated trees can be found in kpg_simulations.R

Figures generated by kpg_simulations.R can be found in the "figs" folder. For reference, the vignette for the using TESS, as well as a PDF of Thompson and Ramirez-Barahona (2023) and its supplemental document, are included in this repository.
